    "Yes K-means is sensitive to outliers.K-means can be used as outlier detection. In K-means, using the symmetric distance measure which is the key component to define the samples that belongs to the same cluster. symmetric distance measurement gives similar weight to each dimension (feature) this may not always be the case for defining outliers.\n",

    "If we add a single  23  to that, the mean becomes  5 , which is larger than any of the other values.\n",

    "Since in k-means, we take the mean a lot, and wind up with a lot of outlier-sensitive calculations.\n",
